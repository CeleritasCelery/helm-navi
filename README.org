** Installation

Install the package from MELPA and you're all set!

If you want to install it manually, put the two =.el= files in your =load-path=, then add this to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'helm-outshine)
  (require 'helm-navi)
#+END_SRC

** Commands

+  =helm-navi=: Show all headings and keywords provided by =navi-mode= in a Helm buffer.  This is the equivalent of running =outshine-navi= and then pressing =C-8 a=.
+  =helm-outshine=: Show Outshine headings in Helm buffer.

** Contributions

Yes, please.
