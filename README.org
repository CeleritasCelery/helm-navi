** Installation

Install the package from MELPA and you're all set!

If you want to install it manually, put =helm-navi.el= in your =load-path=, then add this to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'helm-navi)
#+END_SRC

** Commands

+  =helm-navi=: Show all =navi-mode= keywords and =outshine= headings in a Helm buffer.  This is the equivalent of running =outshine-navi= and then pressing =C-8 a=.
+  =helm-navi-headings=: Show all =outshine= headings in Helm buffer.
